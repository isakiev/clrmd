Since moving to .Net Core we have had to remove references to CodeDOM, which
handled compiling tests for us.  As a result, we now need a one-off step to
generate test assets for use during testing.

To do this, first install both the x86 and x64 version of Debugging Tools
for Windows (windbg, cdb, etc).  Then you will need to set the following
environment variables:

set CSC=[path_to_csc]
set Debug32=[path_to_32bit_cdb_folder]
set Debug64=[path_to_64bit_cdb_folder]

Then run build_test_assets.cmd.

For example:
	set CSC=c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\csc.exe
	set DEBUG32=d:\x86\
	set DEBUG64=d:\amd64\
	build_test_assets.cmd
